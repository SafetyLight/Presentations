# Title
Kidnapping a Library: How Ransomware Taught the British Library to Follow Well-Known Best Practices

## Description
In 2023 one of the largest libraries in the world fell victim to a ransomware attack. Their online catalogs were down for months, and the cost of recovery exceeded eight million dollars. In March 2024 the Library posted a detailed 18-page account of what happened and what they learned from the experience. I studied the full report so you don’t have to.

If the analysis contains any surprises, it’s that there are no real surprises: the problems the British Library faced are common to many businesses, and the improvements the Library developed in response to the attack are reassuringly familiar best practices. We know how to reduce risk from ransomware.

This 35-minute talk draws from the Library’s report to summarize the attack and explain how security controls such as network monitoring capabilities, multi-factor authentication, defined intrusion response processes, holistic risk management, and cyber-risk awareness at senior levels would have made a difference for the British Library-–and might in your company too.

## Comments
The first version of this talk, presented at the Oregon Cyber Resilience summit, was about 25 minutes long. I subsequently delivered a shorter version (10 minutes) for the Technology Association of Oregon and a longer version (35 minutes) for a client as part of their security awareness program. The slides here on GitHub come from the longer version.

## Recording(s)

## Intended Audience
This talk is for a general audience interested in understanding how a specific ransomware attack unfolded at a major cultural institution.

## Key Takeaways
- Ransomware attacks can be catastrophic.
- Even a company that already has a security program can fall victim to an attack.
- Legacy systems can be a surprisingly devastating vulnerability.
- To protect against ransomware, follow best practices from standards such as NIST 800-53.
