# Title
Beyond the Hacker Stereotype: Exploring Cybersecurity Careers You Didn’t Know Existed

## Description
Cybersecurity is often portrayed as a world dominated by hackers and pen testers—but there’s so much more to it than that. From legal advice and privacy compliance to product support and partner integration, the cybersecurity workforce offers a wide variety of roles suited to many different skills and interests.

In this 20-minute talk, we’ll use the NIST NICE Framework to explore the range of cybersecurity opportunities. Whether you’re technical or not, cybersecurity has a place for you. Discover how you can contribute to cybersecurity and learn about the career paths that might lie ahead.
