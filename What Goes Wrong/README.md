# Presentation Title
What Goes Wrong? Common Security Problems in Web Applications

## Description

## Comments
I developed this talk for a client who wanted OWASP Top Ten training for their developers. The first version was 
intended for a company with an appsec background and whose product was written in PHP using Yii. The second version
picked examples more appropriate for entry level developers.
