# Title
What Goes Wrong? Common Security Problems in Web Applications

## Description
This one-hour security awareness training is intended for software development teams. Based on the OWASP Top Ten Web Application Security Risks (2021), it highlights common security vulnerabilities and effective preventive measures. The training includes code examples to illustrate key concepts, ensuring participants leave with a foundational understanding of application security issues and solutions.

This session aligns with compliance frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, and NIST, which emphasize the importance of secure coding practices and security training as part of a robust Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
