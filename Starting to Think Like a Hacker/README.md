# Presentation Title
Starting to Think Like a Hacker: Some Easy Ways to Break a Website

## Description
What does it mean to hack a website? What does a website hacker actually do? This talk demonstrates basic techniques requiring no special tools beyond a browser and a vulnerable website. This talk targets a non-technical audience who is curious to understand better what a vulnerability looks like. The examples are simple, well-known exploits for doing things like downloading restricted files, getting administrator rights, and posting comments under another userâ€™s name.

## Intended Audience
This talk targets a non-technical audience curious to understand better what a vulnerability looks like. It assumes only a notional familiarity with HTML and HTTP.

## Key Takeaways
- See how simple, well-known vulnerabilities, achievable with only the tools in a browser, can be exploited.
- Improve your ability to recognize and think about security weaknesses.

## Comments
This talk was accepted for the Oregon Cyber Resilience Summit in October of 2023, but life events intervened and I was unable to deliver it. It's still waiting for a chance to see the light of day...
