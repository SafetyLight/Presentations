# Presentation Title
Everyday Ethics: Examples for Software Teams

## Description
This talk presents a series of simple situations drawn from my experience in the business of software development and challenges the audience to consider circumstances that might lead to ethical or unethical outcomes. Examples include "Someone outside your company asks you to show them what you are working on," or "You find a serious vulnerability that would let you download private data belonging to other users." Circumstances that might affect your choice of action in the first situation include who the other person is, whether an NDA is in effect, and what exactly you are working on. In the second case, it might matter whether you are an employee, a penetration tester, or a hacktivist. 

This is an interactive talk involving the audience in thinking of regulatory, policy-related, and ethical circumstances that might affect their assessment of each situation.

## Intended Audience
This talk is for people who are hoping to enter the workforce and curious to know how ethical concerns play out in real life.

## Key Takeaways
- Ethical decison-making is context-dependent.
- Awareness of consequences matters.

## Comments
This talk was designed for a 400-level Computer Science class called _Cybersecurity and Professional Practices_. I was invited to speak on the topic of Professional Ethics and Practices. I was told the students were eager for a sense of what working in a company is really like.
