# Presentation Title
What Goes Wrong? Common Security Problems in Web Applications

## Description
The presentations in this folder are different versions of a one-hour security awareness training for software development teams. Based on the OWASP Top Ten Web Application Security Risks, they highlight common security vulnerabilities and effective preventive measures. The training includes code examples to illustrate key concepts, ensuring participants leave with a foundational understanding of application security issues and solutions. 

This session aligns with compliance frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, and NIST, which emphasize the importance of secure coding practices and security training as part of a robust Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

## Intended Audience
Technical software developers.

## Key Takeaways
Participants will:
- Gain familiarity with OWASPâ€™s Top Ten Web Application Security Risks.

## Comments
I sometimes adjust the examples in the talk for different audiences, resulting in different versions. I also made a version targeting a less technical non-programmer audience. That version is in a different folder under the title "Starting to Think Like a Hacker."
