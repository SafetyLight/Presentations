# Presentation Title
A Minimum Viable Security Program: The Critical Early Steps

## Description
Security breaches don’t wait for your first compliance audit. Small companies face the same cyber threats as large enterprises but often delay security, viewing it as complex, expensive, and compliance-driven. In reality, basic security is essential business protection that requires less effort than a compliance audit. Security, like quality, must be designed into systems from the start—not retrofitted after you’ve built them.

While small-business guidance from authorities such as NIST and CIS usefully confirms the importance of critical controls such as access management and endpoint protection, their guidance also misses key risks such as remote work, BYOD, and governance. Your real starting point is identifying and systematically addressing your actual risks.

This talk demonstrates a three-tier approach to implementing a first-step security progam:<br>
• Foundation: Asset inventories, data classification, and risk assessment<br>
• Safeguards: Identity management, access control, and endpoint protection<br>
• Operations: Remote work policies, BYOD management, and governance structures<br>

You’ll see real examples of inventories, risk registers, and policies that you can adapt for your own use.

## Intended Audience
This talk targets a non-technical audience curious to understand better what a vulnerability looks like. It assumes only a notional familiarity with HTML and HTTP.

## Key Takeaways
- Why building security early protects more than compliance
- A practical framework for resource-constrained security
- How risk-based prioritization simplifies decisions
