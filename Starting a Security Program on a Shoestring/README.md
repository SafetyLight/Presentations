# Presentation Title
Starting a Security Program on a Shoestring

## Description
You’re part of a small development team building a web application, and now someone tells you your product must be secure. Perhaps the requirement comes from an auditor or a prospective client. No one on your team was hired for security expertise. What should you do? How can you make meaningful progress with minimal knowledge? Where should you start?

You could hire experts, get training, identify risks and threats, prioritize your findings, design solutions, and implement them. That is the right way to go, but it makes for a slow start with a lot of heavy lifting up front. For those without that option I propose a much easier way to get quick results and long-term improvements with minimal initial investment: just incorporate a vulnerability scanner–there are some good free ones–into your software development processes.

This paper explains how to set up a simple vulnerability management program that will give you immediate results, make your application more secure, improve your secure development lifecycle, help your team develop expertise relevant to their project, and meet some likely compliance requirements.

Along the way, I’ll provide tips for choosing a vulnerability scanner that suits you. I’ll show you how to understand what the scanner finds. I’ll explain a simple process you can follow to turn your scan activity into a vulnerability management program. And I’ll point out resources to help with questions you’ll have along the way.

## Intended Audience
This presentation was conceived for an audience of quality assurance professionals who might be new to application security and looking for a way to get started. It is also a decent depiction of how a security program might evolve from small grass-roots actions in a startup.

## Key Takeaways
- You can start a team’s security program quickly by beginning with vulnerability management.
- To pick the right vulnerability scanner you must understand the different kinds of scanners and their features.
- The internet offers many online resources to answer questions you may have about scanner findings.
- Starting with vulnerability management is a great way to guide your team towards learning application security concepts.

## Comments
The talk was conceived for PNSQC, but since it featured ZAP it was also a reasonable fit for ZAPCon.

The research on slide 8 is certainly out of date by now. Other, better open source scanners may have appeared in the meantime. ZAP, however, is still going strong (though it is no longer an OWASP project.)

ZAP is in some ways not the ideal beginner's tool for the purposes imagined in this talk. I would have preferred to find something that's easier to run correctly the first time--perhaps even a command-line tool. So it would be worthwhile to take a look at what's out there now.
